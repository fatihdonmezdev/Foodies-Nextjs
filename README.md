# **What is the project?**

This project is an Food Recipe Sharing application I made with the help of Maximillian's course. I tried to write all the code on my own and get help only when I got stuck from the course.
Validations for forms on Server Side,  useFormState Hook from React, Server actions from Next.js 14,Next.js 14 revalidating paths(caching), Next.js Server actions.
**The design is taken from the course, NOT MINE**


## **Which technologies are used?**
The tech stack is:

Next.js & CSS5/CSS Modules, SQLite DB, Slugify, Server Side validations, useFormState hook for form action, Revalidating paths(caching).

**I added generating Metadata for all detail pages with their slugs for SEO.**

## **How to run the project?**
1. Clone the project using Git.
2. Open the project folder with a terminal.
3. Run "npm install"
4. Run "npm run dev"
and it works!
